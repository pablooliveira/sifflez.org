    To effectively program parallel architectures it is important to combine a
    simple expression of the parallelism with efficient compiler optimizations. We
    propose a novel stream programming framework based on two domain specific
    languages that separate these two issues. A high-level declarative language
    allows to describe data dependencies between filters while an intermediate
    language enables powerful optimizations through a set of stream graph
    transformations. This two level approach offers a clean separation between the
    issue of programming complexity and the issue of target specific optimization.

Stream languages offer a simple multi-core programming model and achieve good performance. Yet expressing data rearrangement patterns (like a matrix block decomposition) in these languages is verbose and error prone. In this paper, we propose a high-level programming language to elegantly describe n-dimensional data reorganization patterns. We show how to compile it to stream languages.

  Stream languages explicitly describe fork-join parallelism and pipelines, offering a powerful programming model for many-core Multi-Processor Systems on Chip (MPSoC). In an embedded resource-constrained system, adapting stream programs to fit memory requirements is particularly important. In this paper we present a new approach to reduce the memory footprint required to run stream programs on MPSoC. Through an exploration of equivalent program variants, the method selects parallel code minimizing memory consumption. For large program instances, a heuristic accelerating the exploration phase is proposed and evaluated. We demonstrate the interest of our method on a panel of ten significant benchmarks. Using a multi-core modulo scheduling technique, our approach lowers considerably the minimal amount of memory required to run seven of these benchmarks while preserving throughput.
